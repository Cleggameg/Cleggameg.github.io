    Setting up your own personal website is difficult. It’s difficult because it’s something that you make about yourself, for others. I think that makes it inherently difficult because it needs to be true to you and who you are, but it’s made to be seen by others, not yourself.

    In terms of the website I made, I think it was rather basic. The reason that I chose to keep it that way is I wanted it to be something that I could change as I gained experience. I feel that keeping it simple allows for it to be drastically altered in the future, which is something I definitely want to do.

    I like designing the whole site from scratch, I think it was a lot of fun. I thought it was challenging to have all these files in HTML. I found it challenging making updates to the core structure for all the pages. When those occurred, I found myself going through each page and making those same changes over and over. I found it very tedious, but ultimately it was worth doing. Overall, I think this website will become a source of pride for me.
