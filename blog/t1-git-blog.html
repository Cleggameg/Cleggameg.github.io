      Have you ever done something horrible and then wished you could just go back in time before that horrible thing happened? It sure has happened to me more than a few times. Version control lets you do just that. When stuff hits the fan so to speak, you can revert to before everything got mucked up. Version control can let you go back to various commits (checkpoints) that you set up throughout your coding adventures. You can go back a day, week, month, a year. You can go back to any previous commit and restart there, so remember commit early and often. One can never have too many checkpoints.

        Git can help you keep track of the changes that you make within a repository (group of files). It can show you where changes were made and gives you some sort of indication as to what was done though the comments that go along with each commit. You can use these to help you determine where to go back to if the need arises.

        Github is a great place to store your code if it’s something that you want other people to see and potentially work on. Github is a place where your online repositories and projects live, and connects your local git to the larger git community on Github. Assuming your stuff is public, other people can see and copy your code using forking and cloning, allowing others the opportunity to see what you did and make their own modifications to it. You never know, some random person could know how to add the best feature in the world to your program and all they would have to do is see it. Github provides people with a community to connect with others, find new code, and collaborate to make everyone’s code better.
