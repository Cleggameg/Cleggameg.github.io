    In multiple learning style surveys I have come back to be a concrete/random and abstract/sequential. I think it's funny and fitting that I wound up with two opposing learning styles. Despite them being opposites, they're actually fairly similar. In both instances, it claims I would like working best on my own. Though I find this to be true within most facets of my life, I feel that it's not true in relation to programming. This difference is predominantly due to knowledge level. With things that I am comfortable with, I like to work by myself; however, with things that are new, I like to be paired with other people. I think this is why I ended up doing well with this weeks challenges, they allowed for lots of pairing.

    I think that DBC has been a steady path thus far. Nothing seems to be too daunting nor insurmountable. I feel that some of the time I would spend more time than necessary struggling, but ultimately, was always successful.

    I'm not looking forward to the day that I ultimately can't solve a problem. I know that this day is quickly approaching and am not happy about it. Despite that, I feel like challenge breeds excellence, through struggling with coding, I will become a better coder. I feel this all comes back to the idea of growth mindsets. One must view that they have the potential to grow in order to realize their true growth potential. Actually, I really enjoyed writing this blog. It was a good reminder that problems happen, struggle happens, and it's ok. So long as we grow from out struggle, things should ultimately improve.
