    A conflict that I’ve had was when making purchases at the grocery store with my partner. We argue all the time about what to get and what not to get. The source of the conflict derives from the fact that I have a restricted diet and do not have the most money in the world to spend on groceries. He will often put incredibly expressive things in our cart that I can not eat and want to split the bill. I feel as though he does not respect the situation that I am in when he wants me to pay for half of some exotic cheese. We ended up developing a won’t-eat-it won’t-pay-for-it policy so you only pay for the food you eat. It’s a little taxing at times, but it allows us to both get the things we want without feeling like we putting in more than our fair share.

    Writing about conflict in my own life has really forced me to think about the reasons behind my more blanketed emotions to get to the core of my feelings. I started to think about the opposite, to break down happiness. I think it’s important to think about that too, because it is something we should all be seeking, and something we all overlook.
