    Being a former teacher in inner-city Chicago, I dealt with issues related to stereotype threat on a daily basis. Stereotype threat is something that I come up through interactions between others and my students, who were all black, as well as my students and their interactions with me, a gay, white male.
    </p>
    <p>
    Stereotype threat affected me while teaching due to the fact that many of my students continuously brought up my race as well as my orientation. The fact that they heavily emphasized both resulted it me trying to minimize or downplay the level to which I fit into stereotypes related to those identities. When put into situations were adhering to stereotypes was unavoidable, I found myself inclined to increase the adherence to those stereotyped behaviors, as combatting them seemed frivolous.
    </p>
    <p>
    I think that the best way to avoid stereotype threat is somewhat of a cliche. I think that in order to minimize it, one needs to be cognizant of it. Through this awareness one is able to realize the stereotypes that are being placed upon them, or that one is placing upon others, and access its validity. Is it valid that someone or myself expects x because of identify y? The follow-up would be through analysis, does y cause x? If not, recognize and internalize that it does not. If so, think about why it is that you believe that, often times one will find through further contemplation that it does not. I think that this is something that happens on an individual level. It happens due to individualized thoughts imposed by the collective. I think the most effective way to combat it is though the questioning of one’s self and the role stereotypes play within their own thoughts and actions. Additionally, through the questioning of others’ ideas, allowing them the opportunity to question their own beliefs that may be unfounded.
