    When I think about the times I’ve been happiest, proudest, and most satisfied I think of the values of courage, adventure, autonomy, growth, and accomplishment. Despite the fact that I hold these values so closely, i would not say I always embody them. I rated how much I live up to these values on a scale from 1-5. The results are below:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li class="values">Courage: 3</li>
      <li class="values">Adventure: 2</li>
      <li class="values">Autonomy: 5</li>
      <li class="values">Accomplishment: 3</li>
      <li class="values">Growth: 4</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    I think adventure is important to me because it’s something that I feel lucky to be afforded. Being adventurous to me symbolizes the ability to go outside of your normal circumstance. I think it’s fun to defy the expectations that are put on you by society and yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
    The last time someone asked me for advice, it was related to something financial. I think that it was relevant to the values I chose: autonomy and growth. Good finances are dependent on growth and allow you greater autonomy.
    </p>
    <p>
    When I think about my values, it makes me feel more worthy of value. It’s nice to think about how the things you think are important are actually important. I think that it could definitely help to think about your values in order to fight stereotype threat. When you think about what it is that is important to you, it is easier to abide by those values.
    </p>
    <p>
    Thinking about values and the realization of values is something I think will help me keep my focus. I will also meditate on the potential that I have and the possibility for improvement.
