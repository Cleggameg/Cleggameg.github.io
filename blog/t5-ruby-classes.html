    Ruby classes can be used in order to model real-world objects. I’ve been thinking about this in terms of my previous career of teaching and came up with the idea of tackling the dreaded task of making seating charts.
    </p>
    <p>
    A seating chart, if you forgot is something that arranging where students sit within the classroom. This could be done on a 1 student per desk level or could be done where students sit at tables. As a science teacher, I had always had my students sitting in groups at tables. Sometimes I would need to make sure certain students did not sit near each other. Ruby could do all of this.
    </p>
    <p>
    I’d want to start out by defining the class and then defining methods to go within that class.
    </p>
    <p>
    The first method would be some sort of initialization. In this case, I would want my initialization to accept an array of names and the number of students per table. The student names and numbers of students per table would act as instance variables that would drive the rest of your methods. With these variables you could then define methods for that randomize the students names within the array and segregate them into arrays equal to the number of students per table. Additional methods could count the number of students in the class and check to make sure that certain students did not end up at the same table (though this would not involve instance variables, it could still be fun to program). Depending on how fancy you wanted to get, you could even create a method that printed all the information to the council in an easy to read list of arrays.
    </p>
    <p>
    Anyway, creating classes can be really useful in terms of creating real life objects in ruby as well as simulating and solving real life problems.
