    <p>One of the big problems with the tech industry that I think everyone is aware of is diversity. Diversity has always been an issue in technology. Some believe it is due to the narrow candidate pool, the fact that tech companies fill their vacancies from the same places over and over again, which gives them the same kinds of people, over and over again. I think thatâ€™s part of the issue, but I think that a larger part is just the fact that many minorities are not encouraged to enter the field at all. Cultural barriers prevent many individuals from even seeking out the qualifications in order to enter the tech industry, even prior to them not being chosen over an equally qualified candidate.
    </p>
    <p>I think the problem is one that has to be addressed at the most fundamental level. We need to make tech and tech related skills not only accessable to everyone, we need everyone exposed to them. We need students, from a very young age to be given tech related problems so that they have experience within the field prior to getting to college. I think that if this happens, we will end up with significantly more diverse candidate pools, which would put significantly more pressure on tech firms to prioritize diversity when hiring.
