    Asking questions effectively is essential to becoming an efficient junior developer. A well crafted questions helps the asker explain the exactly what it is that is the source of confusion, or point of clarification and directs the answerer to the type of response that would be of greatest use to the asker.

    As a former teacher, asking well crafted questions is a craft I have been honing for years. I find its most effective questions to be specific to:  you want to know, a replicable problem(s), and what type of response you are hoping to receive.

    I’ve noticed several patterns when looking though my own as well as other people’s development questions. As a whole, people that provide specifics are more likely to get their answer. Additionally, coded examples tend to get coded solutions. It’s much more likely that people will solve your specific problem if you include some specific code. I have always noticed that well phrased questions are usually taken more seriously and receive more feedback and better feedback that poorly phrased questions. It’s similar to reading the news, no one wants to read a poorly constructed article. Similarly, no one wants to read a poorly phrase or explained question. The better you present your confusion, the more likely it will be handled appropriately.
