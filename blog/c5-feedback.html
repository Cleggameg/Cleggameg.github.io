      Pairing has been something that I have come to look forward to here at DBC. I did not like doing it at first. It seemed unnecessary and cumbersome, but it’s turned into something I really enjoy. I like working with other people and being able to instantly access them for feedback and advice. I think the main reason that I pair so successfully is that I am not at all hung up about saying when I do not understand. I find it difficult when people are unable to do this, it really gets in the way of being successful.    </p>
    <p>
      In relation to feedback, I always get nervous before receiving it. I have almost always found my feedback helpful. If I ever feel like I could have done better on a particular challenge, my pair usually points that same issue out. My feedback suggests that I should fully read and understand the challenge prior to pairing on it. I admit that this has happened, and will work to make it not happen in the future. I have also found that my feedback often does not always have suggestions for improvement, and found this to sometimes be the most difficult part of writing feedback. It is difficult to be critical of people when you feel like they did a good job. Pointing out actionable things can be difficult if you think they did amazingly.

      Overall, I found the process of pairing and using feedback to be a great way to go through phase 0. I think it’s great to work with other people who are struggling with the same issues as myself. Giving and receiving feedback is helpful as well. I wish I were getting more feedback outside of my pairing sessions, but they’re very good at pointing out general avenues of improvement.
