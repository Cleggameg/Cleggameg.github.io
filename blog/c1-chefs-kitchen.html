    At DBC, you get out of it what you put into it. You’re working as a team in order to get the most out of the experience. You need to take ownership of your experience, because it’s all you get. I like that it’s set up that way. I like that that you’ll define your own experience. I think that I’ll fit into this type of model, because I tend to be of the “act first, apologize later” camp of doing things. I’ve always believed that it’s better to fail magnificently than to never really put yourself out there.

    I think my expectations of DBC have changed. On some level I thought I was paying for something I would get; however, the more I think about it, the more I realize I’m paying for an experience. What I get out of that experience is entirely up to me. I like that feeling: to know that if I get something amazing out of it, it’ll be because I did it, I earned it. For this reason, I’m excited to do this type of experience, but I’m also very nervous. If I don’t get as much as I would have wanted, that’s also on me. I’m the one in control of myself… that’s liberating… this liberation costs security. I want more adventure in my life, if I wanted security, I wouldn’t be leaving my job to do this. Screw security.
